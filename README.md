# Spring MVC Template for Salesforce

This is a template for a Spring MVC web application to work with data from Salesforce.
The sample code is a dynamic CRUD application that allows users to create, read, edit, and delete any Salesforce object.
It is backed by the [Rich SObjects](https://github.com/ryanbrainard/richsobjects) library for interactions with Salesforce.
